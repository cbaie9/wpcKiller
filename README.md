# And now a ui (user interface)
I've created a "ui" for user who want to unistall, repair and add custom argument to their pc
Once you install Wpckiller type win+r and in the Box who just opened %programdata%\wpc
And finally lunch the Utilitary.bat file

Ps : to choose a selection type number just before 
Ps2 : Don't break your pc with argument, add argument if only you know what you are doing
